# Expo CLI Build Errors: Version Mismatch and Configuration Issues

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: build errors stemming from version mismatches between the Expo CLI and project dependencies, or from incorrect project configurations.

## Problem
The primary problem is that newer versions of Expo may have different requirements or incompatibilities with older libraries.  Likewise, incorrect configurations in your project files can lead to failures during the build process.

## Solution
The key to fixing this involves thoroughly checking your dependencies and configurations:

1. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you're using the latest stable version.
2. **Update Dependencies:**  Verify that `react-native`, `expo`, and other core libraries are updated to compatible versions. Check for version conflicts and resolve any inconsistencies.
3. **Review app.json and package.json:**  Carefully examine these files for errors, missing plugins, or incorrect dependency versions.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Use `expo prebuild` and `expo start` to clean the project and rebuild. Sometimes a cached build can lead to false error messages.
5. **Check for Typos:**  Double-check package names for typos in your `package.json` file.
6. **Check the Expo Docs:** The official Expo documentation often provides information on troubleshooting specific build errors and known version incompatibilities.
