This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the project's dependencies, particularly with React Native and related libraries.  For instance, you might be using a newer Expo CLI with an older version of `react-native`, causing incompatibility issues during the build process.  Another common cause is incorrect or outdated configuration within your `package.json` or `app.json` files, such as specifying incompatible dependencies or missing required plugins. This can manifest as cryptic error messages during compilation or runtime, often related to modules not being found or conflicting versions.
